<h2><strong>GUI Overview</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Config Basics</b> tab: input parameters common to all models (e.g., domain grid, simulation time, choice/frequency of outputs)</li>
<li><b>Microenvironment</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp; microenvironment parameters that are model-specific</li>
<li><b>User Params</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user parameters that are model-specific</li>
<li><b>Out: Cell Plots</b> tab:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output display of the cells</li>
<li><b>Out: Substrate Plots</b> tab: output display of the substrates</li>
</ul>
Clicking the 'Run' button will use the specified parameters and start a simulation. When clicked, it creates an "Output" widget
that can be clicked/expanded to reveal the progress (text) of the simulation. When the simulation generates output file(s),
they can be visualized in the appropriate output tabs. The "Max" count in each output tab will be dynamically updated 
as those output files are generated by the running simulation. When the "Run" button is clicked, it toggles to a "Cancel" button
that will terminate (not pause) the simulation.


<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

<p>
This app demonstrates ... 
</p>


<p>This model and cloud-hosted demo are part of a course on computational multicellular systems biology created and taught by 
    Dr. Paul Macklin in the Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering at Indiana University. It is also part of the education 
    and outreach for the IU Engineered nanoBIO Node and the NCI-funded cancer systems biology grant U01CA232137. 
    The models are built using <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991" target="_blank">PhysiCell</a>: 
    a C++ framework for multicellular systems biology [1].</p>

<p>Modify the parameters in the &quot;Config Basics&quot; and &quot;User Params&quot; tabs. Click the &quot;Run&quot; button once you are ready.</p>

<p>To view the behavior of the cells , click the &quot;Cell Plots&quot; tab, and slide the bar to advance through simulation frames. 
Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;Max&quot; field (maximum frame number) will increase, so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>To view the changing substrate fields, click the &quot;Substrate Plots&quot; tab, choose a substrate from the drop-down menu, 
and slide through the saved times. Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;max&quot; field (maximum frame number) will increase, 
so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>Note that you can download full simulation data for further exploration in your tools of choice.</p>
